Closebee is the most powerful website enquiry capture system. Quick, painless, spam proof contact form widgets which ask less and get a lot more.

## Description

More than 20 million sites using contact forms but a very little effort has been put into reducing the customer input time while enhancing the customer intelligence.
Contact forms for an enquiry usually take more than a minute to fill. They are error prone, spam prone and repetative.
The customer focuses more time in correctly entering his personal information rather than entering info about the service he really wants.

[Closebee](https://closebee.com) is the answer to these millions of deployments to reduce the customer interaction time to seconds while gathering 10X more information about the customer.

1. Closebee makes sure your customer focuses on the requirement rather than filling their personal information.
1. Closebee contains a enquiry CRM which nurtures every enquiry that is captured.
1. Closebee notifies you and your customer of the enquiry and sets up a conversation channel to talk to your customer.
1. Closebee Site Manager monitors customer navigation to site sections, items and captures customer intentions. 
1. Closebee utilizes advanced AI and Prediction techniques to predict your enquiry conversion probability. 
1. Closebee is pure SAAS and REST so its footprint on your site functions are barely minimal.
